Create three folders named: excels, graphs, weights.

Then change data folders in the code.

I cut images on the fly by using the numbers in the json files. You may want to create your json files or delete the part of the code that uses these files.

json files like: {"file_name.dcm": [131, 387, 62, 446], ...}
