# PhDThesisCodes-other-than-paper-codes

You may want to start with README.md file of TopologyAware folder which contains submitted paper codes.

Then you'll find other type of topological filter implementations here. Also projection folder contains novel type shape-preserving method. Please see the PhD Thesis file.

baseMulty: Network with cross-entropy loss - multy-class segmentation.
baseMultyActDefWeight: Network with size-weight matrix * cross-entropy loss.
ourMulty: Implementation of paper's method to multy-class segmentation dataset.
RF: Radial Filtration as topological filter method.
RFFocus: Radial Filtration as topological filter method, implemented to bounding box.
HF: Height Filtration as topological filter method, implemented to bounding box.
projection: A novel shape preserving method. Please see the PhD Thesis file.
